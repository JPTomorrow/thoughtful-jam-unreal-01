## Game Description

(WIP Idea) Felice described this idea as a second person perspective game, where you play as a dude running from a ghost in the woods but you are playing a game on your phone that is so addicting that you cant stop playing it, even with a ghost chasing you. The goal of the game could be to finish the phone game so that the player can access the home screen on his phone to open the flashlight app and kill the ghost by shining a light on it.

The "Set Up" would be the ghost trying to set you up for success by scaring you off of your phone and helping you conquer your phone addiction. Maybe a ending where the player kills the ghost so that they can keep playing the addicting phone game, but if the ghost catches you, we try to portray "getting over your phone addiction" as comedically scary to the player character. Having that kind of comedic inverted horror where the ghost is trying to do something good for you, could satisfy the "Thought Provoking" aspect of the jam.

## How to contribute with a Pull Request (Ask if you don't know how to use Git and I'll help you out)
 
** BEFORE YOU GET TO WORKING ON A CONTRIBUTION, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MASTER BRANCH PULLED LOCALLY ON YOUR PC EVERY MORNING, THIS WILL SAVE A LOT OF HEADACHE WHEN YOU GO TO MAKE YOUR PULL REQUEST **

1. Make a new branch using whatever git client you are comfortable using.
2. Make your changes.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to your branch.
5. Create a pull request for your branch on Github.
6. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by me and merged into master branch.

- When you are working on a new feature, be careful not to change any files or assets that don't pertain to the feature you are working on. This will make it easier to merge your changes into the master branch. If you change an asset someone else is working on, it will be difficult to merge as we will have to resolve conflicts for that file. If you don't know what this means, get in touch with me and I'll explain it to you.
